## About Me

I'm a Mechatronic Engineering student pursuing a combined Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Master of Engineering at The University of Queensland, and I am passionate about computer vision and robotics. Through this course, I'm developing skills in image processing, biometric systems, and neural network architectures.

## Blog Focus Areas

This blog documents my exploration of several key areas:

1. **Fingerprint Recognition Systems** - Implementation challenges and performance optimization
2. **GPU vs CPU Performance** - Practical experiments on training acceleration
3. **Image Classification** - Building and training custom classifiers using fastai
4. **Development Environment Setup** - Configuration tips for deep learning workflows

## Recent Learning Highlights

- Successfully implemented a ROC curve analysis for biometric systems
- Achieved a 25Ã— speedup when migrating from CPU to GPU processing
- Created a custom t-SNE visualisation to understand feature spaces
- Scraped and processed web images for multi-class classification

## Technical Skills Developed

```python
# Skills grow through deliberate practice
skills = ['PyTorch', 'fastai', 'OpenCV', 'Docker', 'GitHub']
knowledge = ['CNNs', 'Transfer Learning', 'Biometrics', 'Feature Extraction']

for skill in skills:
    print(f"Practicing {skill} through hands-on projects")
    
# Learning never stops!
```

Follow along as I document successes and challenges in applying these technologies to real computer vision problems.
