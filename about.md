## Professional Profile

I'm a highly motivated Mechatronics Engineering student at The University of Queensland, pursuing a combined Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Master of Engineering degree. With a strong foundation in both software and hardware systems, I'm particularly passionate about applying computer vision and deep learning techniques to solve real-world engineering challenges.

## Research Interests

My academic interests align closely with ELEC4630's focus on image processing, computer vision, and deep learning. I'm fascinated by the intersection of these technologies with robotics systems, autonomous navigation, and intelligent sensing platforms. This blog documents my learning journey through these complex but rewarding fields.

## Professional Experience

Currently, I work as an Associate Research Assistant/Technician at the Sustainable Minerals Institute (UQ) where I've developed specialised Python plugins with PyQt5 GUIs for enhancing 3D image analysis capabilities. This role has deepened my understanding of image segmentation, advanced preprocessing techniques, and connected component analysis—skills directly applicable to computer vision.

Previously, I've gained valuable hands-on experience at XL Metal Industries, developing precision fabrication skills and an eye for detail that translates well to engineering problem-solving.

## Key Projects

### UQ Rover Basestation
Implemented NASA OpenMCT framework with custom UQ-MCT plugins for rover telemetry visualisation, using Vue.js, JavaScript, WebSockets, Express.js, SQLite, ROS2, and Raspberry Pi. This project involved real-time control interfaces, bidirectional communication systems, and integration with ROS2-based systems—demonstrating my capabilities in complex systems integration.

### Autonomous Vehicle Design
Led the design of a lightweight autonomous vehicle for collecting and depositing tennis balls, using 3D printing, C++, and Arduino. This project provided practical experience with sensor integration and control systems design.

### Solar System Motion Simulator
Engineered a comprehensive simulation system calculating precise orbital elements and physical properties using Python, JavaScript, React, Three.js, SpiceyPy, and Flask. This project showcased my ability to implement complex algorithms and create intuitive visualisations of multi-dimensional data.
